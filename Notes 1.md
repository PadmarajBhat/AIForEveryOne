 * Collecting observation of user behavior from a website
 * Acquiring the data source from open world.
 * Data can be either or structure or semi structured or unstructured data.
 
* **What is :**
  * ML : Program that predicts and developers are focussed on building a model as well as wrapper program.
  * DS : Data science is all about finding insights before the model is built so that company can make decision. 
  * Deep Learning: is to have neural network to find the relation between Input and desired output
 * **Branch Diag**:
   * AI
      * ML
        * DL
      * Knowledge Graph
      * Graphical models 
      * etc
   * Data Science may have a piece from all the 3: AI, ML and DL
