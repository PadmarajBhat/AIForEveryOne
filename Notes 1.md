##### Key Notes from Week 1:
* AI can be broadly categorised to :
  * Artificial Narrow Intelligence: Is all about human driven intelligence being transferred to machine.
  * Artificial General Intelligence: Machine doing more than what humans can do.

* ANI can shine in Retail, Travel , Transport and Logistics etc

* **Acquiring Data**:
 * Manually labelling in case of image datasets
 * Collecting observation of user behavior from a website
 * Acquiring the data source from open world.
 * Data can be either or structure or semi structured or unstructured data.
 
* **What is :**
  * ML : Program that predicts and developers are focussed on building a model as well as wrapper program.
  * DS : Data science is all about finding insights before the model is built so that company can make decision. 
  * Deep Learning: is to have neural network to find the relation between Input and desired output
 * **Branch Diag**:
   * AI
      * ML
        * DL
      * Knowledge Graph
      * Graphical models 
      * etc
   * Data Science may have a piece from all the 3: AI, ML and DL

* In the Internet Era:
  * A/B testing
  * Short decision time
  * decision likes with data engineers
  
* In the AI Era:
  * Data Acquiring stratergies
  * Unified data warehourse: so that engineers can focus on data analysis and not on the policies.
  * Pervasive Automation
  * new role like ML engineer
  
 * AI Transformation steps:
   * Execute Pilot projects to gain momentum
   * Build In house AI Team
   * Provide Broad AI Training
   * Develop AI Stratergy
   * Internal and external communication about the stratergy to stake holders.
   
 * What AI Can Do ?
   * Anything that is simple and takes <= 1 sec of human intuition to predict.
   * The set of activities that AI can do increases constantly. Hence, each project has to carefully reviewed before taking up.
   * My own intuition is that, with the preliminary knowledge of machine learning, would a human agree to the fact that the feature set is instrumental to predict the label or not. If yes, take up tha project.
